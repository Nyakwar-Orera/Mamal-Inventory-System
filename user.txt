Thanks! Since your repository is:

üëâ **[https://github.com/Nyakwar-Orera/Mamal-Inventory-System](https://github.com/Nyakwar-Orera/Mamal-Inventory-System)**
and your local folder is:

üìÅ `C:\Users\admin\Desktop\Mamal Inventory System`

Let‚Äôs push your Flask app correctly to that GitHub repository.

## ‚úÖ STEP-BY-STEP COMMANDS (WINDOWS CMD or Git Bash)

### üìç Step 1: Open Git Bash or CMD

Open **Git Bash** (recommended) or **Command Prompt**.

### üìç Step 3: Remove Previous Git Remote (if needed)

If you already pushed to a different repo earlier, remove the old link first:

```bash
git remote remove origin
```

> Skip this if you've never connected a remote before.

---

### üìç Step 4: Initialize Git (if not already)

```bash
git init
```

---

git remote add origin https://github.com/Nyakwar-Orera/Mamal-Inventory-System.git
```

```bash
git add .
```

---

### üìç Step 7: Commit the Project

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit - Mamal Inventory System Flask App"
```

---

### üìç Step 8: Push to GitHub

```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

### ‚úÖ RESULT

You should now see your Flask project at:
üëâ [https://github.com/Nyakwar-Orera/Mamal-Inventory-System](https://github.com/Nyakwar-Orera/Mamal-Inventory-System)

## üîÑ SHOULD YOU DELETE OLD CODE FROM GITHUB?

* If the current GitHub repo (`Mamal-Inventory-System`) already has old/broken code, yes ‚Äî **you can overwrite it** using the steps above.
* The `git push -u origin main` will replace what's there **if it's empty or newly created**.

If you want a **clean reset**, you can also:

```bash
git push --force origin main
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Use `--force` **only if you're sure** you want to overwrite the remote content.

Would you like me to now generate a `README.md` for your GitHub repo?
